"""The Specs screen — the validation specs on disk, and the way to make one.

One focusable row per `specs/*.json`, with a fix block for the files that could
not be read. Zero specs is the normal state on a fresh install, not a problem,
so it gets a plain note and contributes no fix step.

`n` opens `NewSpecModal` and reloads if it wrote something. The modal takes no
arguments and returns a `Path`, so a second entry point to the create flow is
one `await` away rather than a reimplementation.

Unlike its sibling detail screens it has **no `#setup-prompt` branch**, and the
reason is now stronger rather than weaker: it reads `self.app.specs_dir`, a path
derived from the config *path* rather than its contents, so the page lists and
works identically with an absent or corrupt config.

The directory listing parses JSON per file, so it runs in a `@work` worker via
`asyncio.to_thread` — never on the event loop.
