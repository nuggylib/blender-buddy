"""Bone-name segments, their inverses, and the variants a name implies.

A bone name is a base plus dot-segments: `susarm.front.top.L` is `susarm` with
`.front`, `.top`, `.L`. Every segment either has an inverse (`.L`/`.R` built in,
the rest from the spec's `armature.bone_name_inverses`) or maps to itself.

Pure functions over strings and dicts — the manual form and a later
scene-inferred flow both call these, regardless of where a name came from.
