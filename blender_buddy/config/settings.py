"""The persisted settings shape and its schema version.

``SCHEMA_VERSION`` is written from the first save; bumping it is the anchor a
migration keys off of. All paths are stored as already-normalized absolute
strings (normalization happens at capture time, not here).

Schema history:

- **v1** — ``[models] directory`` held exactly *one* source-models path.
- **v2** — ``[models] directories`` is an array of them. Real projects keep
  models in several places (vehicles, props, characters), which v1 could not
  express. ``store.load`` upgrades a v1 file transparently; see
  ``blender_buddy/config/CLAUDE.md``.
