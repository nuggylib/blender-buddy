``load`` never raises into the caller: it maps every failure to a state so boot
routing can decide (run wizard / boot dashboard / show recovery notice). ``save``
writes once, atomically, so a crash mid-write can never leave a half-written file
that later reads as "setup is done".

``load`` also performs the one-time v1→v2 schema migration — the single
sanctioned exception to this layer being read-only on load (see the category's
``CLAUDE.md``).
